# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository is dataset-first rather than application-first. Keep files grouped by purpose:

- `docs/` for process notes, workflow documentation, and reproducibility details.
- `example dataset/resist house/colmap/` for raw COLMAP inputs such as drone images, `Cameras.txt`, `Images.txt`, `Points3D.txt`, and `reg.csv`.
- `example dataset/resist house/colmap/output/` for derived artifacts such as checkpoints and exported `.ply` files.

Follow the same pattern for new scenes: `<dataset>/<scene>/colmap/` for source material and `<dataset>/<scene>/colmap/output/` for generated results. Do not mix generated files into raw capture folders.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
There is no build system or automated test runner checked in yet. Use lightweight inspection commands while working locally:

```powershell
rg --files
Get-ChildItem "example dataset\resist house\colmap"
Get-Content "example dataset\resist house\colmap\Cameras.txt" -TotalCount 20
```

Use `rg --files` to locate repository content, `Get-ChildItem` to verify dataset layout, and `Get-Content` to spot-check COLMAP text outputs before committing.

## Local Launcher Scripts
This repo includes Windows batch wrappers at the repo root for common local workflows:

- `2-MS-to-Colmap.bat`: drag-and-drop dataset launcher for `Metashape_360_to_COLMAP_plane\metashape_360_to_colmap.py`
- `launch_metashape_gui.bat`: launches `Metashape_360_to_COLMAP_plane\metashape_360_gui.py`

Current expectation for `2-MS-to-Colmap.bat`:

- It is intended to be callable from other working directories.
- `REPO_ROOT` is intentionally hardcoded to `C:\Dev\3DGS\MetaShape360-to-colmap-kotohibi` unless explicitly changed.
- Do not switch it back to `%~dp0`-based repo discovery unless the user asks for relocatable behavior.
- The batch expects a dropped dataset folder containing an `images\` subfolder plus a Metashape `*.xml`; `*.ply` is optional.
- `*.xmp` is not a valid substitute for the required Metashape camera export XML for this converter.
- The batch flattens nested image trees into a temporary folder before invoking the Python script because the current converter scans a single image-directory level.

## External Tool Paths
LichtFeld Studio (LFS) installations used alongside this repository are stored outside the repo:

- Stable: `C:\Users\Azad\Documents\_apps\LichtFeld_Studio\LFS_Stable`
- Nightly: `C:\Users\Azad\Documents\_apps\LichtFeld_Studio\LFS_nightly`
- Repo docs: `C:\Dev\3DGS\LichtFeld-Studio\docs`
- General refs/docs: `C:\Dev\_docs`

Reference these exact paths in documentation or local workflow notes when a task depends on a specific build.

## Host Repo Context
For anything that depends on how LFS itself works, use the host repo as ground truth:

- Host repo: `C:\Dev\3DGS\LichtFeld-Studio`
- Check these first:
  - `C:\Dev\3DGS\LichtFeld-Studio\docs`
  - `C:\Dev\3DGS\LichtFeld-Studio\src\python`
  - `C:\Dev\3DGS\LichtFeld-Studio\src\visualizer`

Do not guess LFS APIs, training behavior, or UI extension points from memory when the host repo is available.

For plugin UI integration work, search the host repo for:

- `add_hook`
- `training_panel.py`
- `register_panel`
- `ui.panel`

For runtime/training behavior, search the host repo for:

- `runtime/events`
- `training.completed`
- `training.stopped`
- `dataset.load_completed`

## Low-Touch Execution
Default expectation: the agent should handle build, test, live verification, evaluation, and iteration with minimal user involvement.

Do not try to overly make preventative fixes for issues that do not exist. do not scope creep. 

Preferred workflow for this repo:

- Run local unit tests and script-based checks without asking the user to verify intermediate results.
- When queue behavior depends on the live app, prefer the GUI MCP HTTP path over fragile in-process `--python-script` verification.
- Use the stable LFS build first unless there is a specific reason to target nightly:
  - `C:\Users\Azad\Documents\_apps\LichtFeld_Studio\LFS_Stable\bin\LichtFeld-Studio.exe`
- For queue debugging, the agent should capture evidence directly from:
  - `plugin.queue.state`
  - `plugin.queue.debug_events`
  - `lichtfeld://runtime/state`
  - `lichtfeld://runtime/events`
- The agent should not tell the user a fix is complete until it has personally run the relevant end-to-end flow and inspected the resulting evidence.
- The agent should only stop and ask the user when:
  - sandbox or permission escalation is required
  - the task depends on a GUI/session state the agent cannot access
  - there is a destructive or ambiguous action that should not be assumed
  - there is a genuine external blocker that cannot be resolved from the repo or local tools

Current queue-specific expectation:

- The agent should launch LFS itself when needed, run the queue verifier itself, inspect the stop point itself, patch only the observed failure, and rerun verification itself.
- User interaction should be treated as exception handling, not the normal validation loop.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Keep your responses to the user short in codex/chats short. do not be verbose unless asked for. this is specifically about the chat experience. docs should be as verbose as need-be. 

Keep Markdown concise and task-focused. For new scripts, prefer Python with 4-space indentation, `snake_case` filenames, and small single-purpose modules. Preserve original camera image names from capture devices. Name generated outputs clearly, for example `output/splat_010000.ply`.

No formatter or linter is configured yet; match surrounding style and keep changes minimal.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no formal coverage target today. Validate contributions by checking that COLMAP text files remain readable and internally consistent, generated artifacts are written only under `output/` or another clearly derived directory, and documentation references real paths and commands.

If you add executable code, include a `tests/` directory and name files `test_<feature>.py`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Git history is not available in this checkout, so use short imperative commit messages such as `Add second sample dataset` or `Document COLMAP output layout`. Keep each commit scoped to one logical change.

Pull requests should include a brief summary, affected dataset paths, validation steps performed, and screenshots only when a visual result changed.

## Data Hygiene
Large binary outputs grow quickly. Avoid duplicating raw imagery, keep regenerated artifacts in derived directories, and document external tools or parameter changes in `docs/` when they affect reproducibility.
